Strain ASDs for different Cosmic Explorer detectors

* cosmic_explorer_strain.txt is the baseline 40 km detector
* cosmic_explorer_20km_strain.txt is the baseline 20 km detector ("compact binary tuned")
* cosmic_explorer_20km_pm_strain.txt is the 20 km detector tuned for post-merger signals
* cosmic_explorer_40km_lf_strain.txt is the 40 km detector tuned for low-freqency signals

Curves are calculated for a source 15 degrees off of normal incidence.
