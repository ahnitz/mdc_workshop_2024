# Example parameter inference for a simulated BNS signal with Cosmic Explorer

### Setup
To aid getting a working environment set up, there are two scripts depending on your preferred method for creating a clean software environment. 
1. based on virtualenv 
2. based on conda

These have been tested on linux, please report any issues or suggest corrections which might help alternate platforms!

### Configuration Files

The simulated signal is defined in `injection.ini` where as the configuration of how its parameters are estimated using PyCBC Inference are given in `reltime.ini`. 
See the PyCBC Inference documentation for more details or reach out to get access to the GWastro slack.
